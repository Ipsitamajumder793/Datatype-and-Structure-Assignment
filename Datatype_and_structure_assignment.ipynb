    "       1. What are Data Structure & why are the important ?\n",
    "           Ans:-  Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that they can be used efficiently.\n",
    "           They define the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on the data. In Python, data structures are\n",
    "           crucial for building efficient and scalable programs. \n",
    "                 Data structures are important for several reasons:\n",
    "                 Efficiency:\n",
    "                     They allow for efficient storage and retrieval of data, which is crucial for performance, especially when dealing with large\n",
    "                     datasets.\n",
    "                 Organization:\n",
    "                     They provide a way to organize data logically, making it easier to understand and work with.\n",
    "                 Problem Solving:\n",
    "                     They provide a framework for solving complex problems by allowing you to choose the right data structure for a specific task.\n",
    "                 Reusability:\n",
    "                     They can be reused across different applications, saving time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "         2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.         \n",
    "            Ans:- Mutable data types: \n",
    "                    These are data types whose values can be modified in place after creation. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "                    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "                    my_list.append(4)\n",
    "                    print(my_list)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "                    my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "                    my_dict['c'] = 3 \n",
    "                    print(my_dict) \n",
    "    \n",
    "   \n",
    "                    my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "                    my_set.add(4) \n",
    "                    print(my_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "                 Immutable data types: These are data types whose values cannot be changed after creation. Any operation that appears to modify\n",
    "                 an immutable object actually creates a new object with the modified value. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.\n",
    "                    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "                    my_tuple[0] = 4  # This would raise an error\n",
    "\n",
    "          3. What are the main difference between list and tuple in Python ?\n",
    "             Ans: - The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after\n",
    "             creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified. Additionally, tuples are more memory-efficient compared to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "          4. Describe how dictionary stored data in Python?\n",
    "             Ans:-  Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\n",
    "                    A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "                    e.g-  my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "          5. Why might you use a set instead of list in Python ?\n",
    "             Ans:-  A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements,\n",
    "             while a list is an ordered collection that can contain duplicate elements. There are several reasons why you might choose to use\n",
    "             a set instead of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "                    Uniqueness:\n",
    "\n",
    "                       If you need to ensure that there are no duplicate elements in your collection, a set is the way to go.\n",
    "                       Adding an element that already exists in the set has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "                    Membership testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "                       Checking if an element is present in a set is much faster than checking if it is present in a list.\n",
    "                       This is because sets are implemented using hash tables, which allow for constant-time lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "                    Set operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "                       Sets provide efficient methods for performing set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "          6.  What is a string in python and how is it different from a list ?\n",
    "              Ans:-  A string is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes. \n",
    "                    Strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created.\n",
    "                    While both lists and strings can be accessed using indexing and slicing, lists provide more flexibility as they can be\n",
    "                    modified, appended, or extended, while strings cannot be altered after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "          7.  How do tuples ensure Data integrity in Python ?\n",
    "              Ans :- Tuples in Python ensure data integrity due to their immutability. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added,\n",
    "                     or removed.\n",
    "                    This characteristic guarantees that the data stored within a tuple remains constant throughout its lifecycle, preventing accidental\n",
    "                    or unauthorized modifications. \n",
    "          8. What is the Hash table and how does it related to the dictionary in  Python ?\n",
    "             Ans :- A Hash Table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values, allowing for fast retrieval of data.\n",
    "                    In Python, the Dictionary data type is built upon the concept of Hash Tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "          9. Can list contain different data types in Python ?\n",
    "             Ans:-  Yes, a list in Python can contain elements of different data types. This is one of the features that makes Python lists very\n",
    "                    flexible. A single list can hold integers, strings, floats, booleans, and even other lists, tuples, dictionaries, or functions.\n",
    "                    e.g.-\n",
    "                     my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3], (4, 5), {\"name\": \"Alice\"}]\n",
    "                     print(my_list)  \n",
    "\n",
    "          10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python ?\n",
    "      \n",
    "             Ans:- Strings in Python are immutable because of several design and performance considerations.\n",
    "                   Immutability means that once a string is created, its value cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string \n",
    "                   actually creates a new string object.\n",
    "                   One key reason for string immutability is to allow strings to be used as keys in dictionaries.\n",
    "                   Dictionaries require their keys to be hashable, and mutability would break the hashing mechanism.\n",
    "                   If a string used as a key were to change, its hash value would change, and the dictionary would no longer be able to locate the\n",
    "                   entry.\n",
    "          11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks in Python?\n",
    "              Ans:-\n",
    "                   Dictionaries in Python offer several advantages over lists for specific tasks:\n",
    "                    Efficient lookups:\n",
    "                    Dictionaries use a hash table implementation, allowing for near-constant time complexity, O(1), for retrieving values based on \n",
    "                    their keys. Lists, on the other hand, require linear time complexity, O(n), for searching, as they may need to iterate through\n",
    "                    each element until the target is found.\n",
    "                    Key-value association:\n",
    "                    Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, making them ideal for representing relationships between data elements. This \n",
    "                    structure enables direct access to values using their corresponding keys, which is more intuitive and efficient than accessing \n",
    "                    elements by index in a list.\n",
    "                    Flexibility:\n",
    "                    Dictionaries can store values of any data type, and keys can be immutable types like strings, numbers, or tuples.\n",
    "                    This flexibility allows for representing complex data structures and relationships.\n",
    "                    Uniqueness of keys:\n",
    "                    Dictionaries enforce the uniqueness of keys, ensuring that each key is associated with only one value. This property\n",
    "                    is useful for maintaining data integrity and avoiding ambiguity.\n",
    "                    Dynamic nature:\n",
    "                    Dictionaries are mutable, allowing for the addition, modification, and deletion of key-value pairs after creation. \n",
    "                    This dynamic nature makes them suitable for tasks where data changes frequently.\n",
    "                    In summary, dictionaries excel in scenarios requiring fast lookups, key-value associations, and flexible data storage, \n",
    "                    while lists are more appropriate for ordered collections and sequential processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "         12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list .\n",
    "               Ans:-\n",
    "                    Tuples are immutable. Hence, they are primarily used to store data that doesn't change frequently.\n",
    "                    Any operation can store data in a tuple when you don't want it to change.\n",
    "                    Tuples are great to use if you want the data in your collection to be read-only, never to change,\n",
    "                    and always remain the same and constant.\n",
    "            \n",
    "         13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
    "               Ans:- \n",
    "                    Sets in Python are designed to store only unique elements.\n",
    "                    When attempting to add a duplicate value to a set, Python automatically discards the duplicate, \n",
    "                    ensuring that the set retains only distinct values. This behavior makes sets useful for tasks such as removing duplicates\n",
    "                    from a list or checking for the presence of unique items.\n",
    "\n",
    "                    E.g. -\n",
    "                     my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}\n",
    "                    print(my_set)\n",
    "                    # Expected output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "         14. How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries in Python ?\n",
    "               Ans :- \n",
    "                     For lists, the in keyword performs a sequential search.\n",
    "                        E.g. --- \n",
    "                        List :-\n",
    "                        my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "                        print(30 in my_list)  \n",
    "                        \n",
    "                        print(60 in my_list)\n",
    "                        \n",
    "                        Dictionary :-\n",
    "                        \n",
    "                    For dictionaries, the in keyword checks for the existence of a key. Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables,\n",
    "                    which allow for near-constant time lookups on average. \n",
    "                        \n",
    "                        E.g.-\n",
    "                        my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n",
    "                        print(\"b\" in my_dict)  \n",
    "                        print(\"d\" in my_dict)\n",
    "                        \n",
    "        15. Can you modify the elements of a Tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
    "             Ans:-\n",
    "                   Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "                    But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "                    E.g.-\n",

    "        16. What is a nested dictionary and give an example of its use case?\n",
    "             Ans:-\n",
    "                   A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where one or more of its values are themselves dictionaries. \n",

    "                Elements from the list can be accessed using the index, while the elements of the dictionary can be accessed using keys.\n",
    "                The list allows duplicate items, while the dictionary does not allow any duplicate keys.\n",
    "                A list can store any data type. In contrast, keys in the dictionary can be of any immutable data type, and values can be of any data type.\n",
